**This AS2 GitHub repository has been archived and is read-only.
The AS2 project is no longer actively maintained.**

Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) is now available at https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension

AS3 is an F5-supported solution which replaces the App Services iApp 2.x (a traditional TCL iApp).

AS3 is built on our extensible programmability framework called iControl LX.

Please use AS3 for all new App Services automation use cases.
